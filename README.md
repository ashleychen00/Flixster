## Notes

This app provided a lot of practice becoming more familiar with Adapters and Intents.
For intents, a challenge for me was deciding what the Context was in that situation,
and what context really means in general.
I also got more practice with the design aspect of xml files,
and was able to group views sort of relative to each other and understand what
match_parent and wrap_content are.
