## Notes

This app provided a lot of practice becoming more familiar with Adapters and Intents.
For intents, a challenge for me was deciding what the Context was in that situation,
and what context really means in general.
It was unclear what parent.getContext() does and where parent comes from,
which was used in the intent to go from the movie list to the specific movie details activity.
As a result, implementing intent on my own to go to the movie details activity to the trailer activity
was a bit of a challenge for me, but I learned more on Java syntax (mostly the purpose of MainActivity.this).
I also got more practice with the design aspect of xml files,
and was able to group views sort of relative to each other and understand what
match_parent and wrap_content are.
